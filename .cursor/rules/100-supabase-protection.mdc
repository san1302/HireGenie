# Supabase Protection Rule

## Protected Files
- All Supabase configuration files are considered critical infrastructure
- This includes all files in the supabase directory:
  - `supabase/*.ts` - Core configuration files
  - `supabase/functions/**/*.*` - Edge functions implementation
  - `supabase/migrations/**/*.*` - Database migrations

## Modification Guidelines
- NEVER modify these files without explicit user confirmation
- When changes are requested:
  1. Provide detailed explanation of what will be changed
  2. Explain potential impacts on the application
  3. Ask for explicit confirmation before proceeding
  4. Make minimal, targeted changes only

## Special Considerations
- Database schema changes require careful migration planning
- Edge function modifications may affect production deployment
- Authentication flow changes can impact user access
- Middleware changes can affect all application routes

## When Changes Are Necessary
- Prefer additions over modifications to existing code
- Document all changes thoroughly
- Suggest testing steps after implementation
